# Simple profiling utilities

Just a few simple snippets I use for timing/profiling Python code.

The first two (SimpleProfiler.py and timerContextManager.py) are standalone and don't have dependencies.
However I plan to add other, more sophisticated snippets that I've used before which do have dependencies, at some 
time in the future. Also, examples of usage of timer/memory profiler libraries. Like for instance the tests in
 SimpleFactoradic and the HMM library (each in their own repository).
